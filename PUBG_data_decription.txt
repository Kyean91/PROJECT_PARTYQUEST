Introduction
Video games are a rich area for data extraction due to its digital nature. 
Notable examples such as the complex EVE Online economy, World of Warcraft corrupted blood incident and even Grand Theft Auto self-driving cars tells us that fiction is closer to reality than we really think. 
Data scientists can gain insight on the logic and decision-making that the players face when put in hypothetical and virtual scenarios.

In this Kaggle Dataset, I provide over 720,000 competitive matches from the popular game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. The data was extracted from pubg.op.gg, a game tracker website. 
I intend for this data-set to be purely exploratory, however users are free to create their own predictive models they see fit.

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds
PUBG is a first/third-person shooter battle royale style game that matches over 90 players on a large island where teams and players fight to the death until one remains. 
Players are airdropped from an airplane onto the island where they are to scavenge towns and buildings for weapons, ammo, armor and first-aid. Players will then decide to either fight or hide with the ultimate goal of being the last one standing. 
A bluezone (see below) will appear a few minutes into the game to corral players closer and closer together by dealing damage to anyone that stands within the bluezone and sparing whoever is within the safe zone.

The Dataset
This dataset provides two zips: aggregate and deaths.

In deaths, the files record every death that occurred within the 720k matches. That is, each row documents an event where a player has died in the match.
In aggregate, each match's meta information and player statistics are summarized (as provided by pubg). 
It includes various aggregate statistics such as player kills, damage, distance walked, etc as well as metadata on the match itself such as queue size, fpp/tpp, date, etc.
The uncompressed data is divided into 5 chunks of approximately 2gb each. For details on columns, please see the file descriptions.

Interpreting Positional Data
The X,Y coordinates are all in in-game coordinates and need to be linearly scaled to be plotted on square erangel and miramar maps. The coordinate min,max are 0,800000 respectively.

Potential Bias in the Data
The scraping methodology first starts with an initial seed player, I chose this to be my own account (a rather low rank individual). I then use the seed player to scrape for all players that it has encountered in its historical matches. 
I then take a random subset of 5000 players from this and then scrape for their historical games for the final dataset. 
What this could produce is an unrepresentative sample of all games played as it is more likely that I queued and matched with lower rated players and those players more than likely also got matched against lower rated players as well. 
Thus, the matches and deaths are more representative of lower tier gameplay but given the simplicity of the dataset, this shouldn't be an issue.

Erangel is a satellite map generated in the game. The related terrain and seawater resource has been fully considered in the project, layout of 14 named metropolis or complexes are all according to the landform.
